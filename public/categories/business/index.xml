      <description>&lt;p&gt;Because I&amp;rsquo;m obsessed with AI, I go to as many AI-related events in London as I can. I blagged a ticket to the launch of Antonio Weiss&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;AI Demystified,&amp;rdquo; which was held in the swanky Financial Times Pearson building on the Strand. After getting a copy of the book, I discovered that a project I&amp;rsquo;d worked on was featured in it. Naturally, that gave me an extra incentive to actually read the thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
