      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve finally finished writing up my notes from Hamel Husain and Shreya Shankar&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://maven.com/parlance-labs/evals&#34;&gt;LLM evaluation course&lt;/a&gt;. It took me longer to write up my notes than it took to actually do the course, but it gave me a good excuse to revisit everything a second time, which is a great way to help cement my learnings. I&amp;rsquo;m going to do one post here to finally capture the key things from each of the lessons, with the hope that I can refer back to this in the future to help me find the detail that I&amp;rsquo;m looking for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
