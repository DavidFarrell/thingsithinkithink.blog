&lt;p&gt;At AI Engineer Paris, &lt;a href="https://swyx.io/aie-paris"&gt;Swyx (Shawn Wang)&lt;/a&gt; laid out his case for why we&amp;rsquo;re entering not just the year of AI agents, but an entire decade of agent-driven transformation from 2025 to 2035. His keynote updated his earlier AI World Fair talk with several converging trends that make this more than typical Silicon Valley optimism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to capture the things that stuck with me from the talk. These stood out:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Three Things I Learned About Voice Agents from Kwindla Kramer</title><link>https://thingsithinkithink.blog/posts/2025/07-04-voice-agents-three-insights-from-kwindla-kramer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2025 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thingsithinkithink.blog/posts/2025/07-04-voice-agents-three-insights-from-kwindla-kramer/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I learned three things from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I86dFivLzXY"&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt; with Hamel Husain and Kwindla Kramer, founder of PipeCat, an open-source framework for voice and multimodal conversation. As someone who hasn&amp;rsquo;t worked much with voice agents, I found three things particularly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="voice-agents-use-traditional-pipelines-not-fancy-models"&gt;Voice Agents Use Traditional Pipelines, Not Fancy Models&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing was learning that most production voice agents don&amp;rsquo;t use the latest speech-to-speech models from OpenAI or Google (etc). Instead, they rely on a modular pipeline approach that breaks the process into discrete steps.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
