      <description>&lt;p&gt;Because I&amp;rsquo;m obsessed with AI, I go to as many AI-related events in London as I can. I blagged a ticket to the launch of Antonio Weiss&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;AI Demystified,&amp;rdquo; which was held in the swanky Financial Times Pearson building on the Strand. After getting a copy of the book, I discovered that a project I&amp;rsquo;d worked on was featured in it. Naturally, that gave me an extra incentive to actually read the thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jackie Bavaro’s breakdown of strategy in her &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/jackie-bavaro-on-how-to-build-product&#34;&gt;recent podcast interview&lt;/a&gt; really stuck with me. She shared a simple (but I think, pretty good) framework that highlights three key components of strategy: &lt;strong&gt;Vision&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Strategic Framework&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Roadmap&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-vision-this-is-where-we-want-to-go&#34;&gt;1. Vision: “This is where we want to go”&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The vision is an inspiring picture of what the future looks like. Jackie framed it:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Hey everyone, this is where we want to get to—don’t you want to build this future with me?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is Psychology or Politics Behind Project Failures?</title>
      <link>https://thingsithinkithink.blog/posts/2025/psychology-and-politics-behind-project-failures/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A key theme from Chapter 2 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.eu/d/ifrzA2p&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;How Big Things Get Done&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; is that while we know we should think slowly and act fast, people often do the exact opposite. The chapter explores the psychological and political forces driving this behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-rush-to-commit&#34;&gt;The Rush to Commit&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The chapter introduces the concept of the commitment fallacy - a behavioural bias where we rush into decisions without proper consideration. The age-old advice &amp;ldquo;Act in haste, repent at leisure&amp;rdquo; captures this perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Does OpenAI&#39;s loss on ChatGPT Pro mean they&#39;re doomed?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A WhatsApp group that I&amp;rsquo;m part of has been discussing whether or not OpenAI is overvalued and in trouble as a result of this recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/05/openai-is-losing-money-on-its-pricey-chatgpt-pro-plan-ceo-sam-altman-says/&#34;&gt;TechCrunch article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key point here is that they believe OpenAI is targeting a traditional mass market product with this £200-a-month offering. Several individuals in the group argue similarly, viewing this as a traditional tech start-up with a product that costs a significant amount to run, raising questions about scalability versus costs. Some members of the group discuss adverts as the natural evolution of any scaling tech platform. One person states, &amp;ldquo;Every platform, when it moves from being a tool to an infrastructure for discovery, ends up running ads.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Think Slow, Act Fast: The Paradox of Project Planning</title>
      <link>https://thingsithinkithink.blog/posts/2025/01-04-think-slow-act-fast-ch-1/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the book &lt;em&gt;How Big Things Get Done&lt;/em&gt;, Bent Flyvbjerg and Dan Gardner presented an analysis of why large projects fail to meet their objectives. As someone who has witnessed the ups and downs of loads of projects, I&amp;rsquo;m very curious to learn what we can do better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the overarching themes of the first chapter is their thesis of &lt;strong&gt;“think slow, act fast.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-iron-law-of-megaprojects&#34;&gt;The Iron Law of Megaprojects&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Flyvbjerg and Gardner share what they term the &lt;strong&gt;“iron law of megaprojects,”&lt;/strong&gt; highlighting an uncomfortable reality: projects are consistently over budget, over time, and under deliver on benefits. It&amp;rsquo;s backed by an extensive database of over 16,000 projects across 136 countries and 20 different fields. The statistics are quite convincing:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
