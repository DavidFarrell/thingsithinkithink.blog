      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anthropic recently released &lt;a href=&#34;https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview&#34;&gt;Cowork mode&lt;/a&gt; for Claude. It&amp;rsquo;s similar to Claude Code in that it&amp;rsquo;s highly agentic, has access to skills, and can make changes to files on your computer. But it has a nicer interface than Claude Code and is aimed at non-programmers, giving them access to the kind of general agent that all of us technical folk have been enjoying for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You select a folder from your hard drive, give Claude a task, and it spins up a little virtual computer of its own that can read and edit those files. It&amp;rsquo;s allowed to browse the web, produce outputs, write its own code, and stuff like this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
