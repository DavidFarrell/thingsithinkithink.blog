      <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent conversation with my friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-sykes-a702b4/&#34;&gt;Dr Jon Sykes&lt;/a&gt; sparked some thoughts about where frameworks derive their value. The conversation started with a question: is the benefit of frameworks really just that they create a shared language? We were discussing my review of Chapter 2 of &amp;ldquo;How Big Things Get Done&amp;rdquo; and examining the framework that is emerging from my reading so far. This led us to identify three distinct sources of value in frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A key theme from Chapter 2 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.eu/d/ifrzA2p&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;How Big Things Get Done&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; is that while we know we should think slowly and act fast, people often do the exact opposite. The chapter explores the psychological and political forces driving this behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the book &lt;em&gt;How Big Things Get Done&lt;/em&gt;, Bent Flyvbjerg and Dan Gardner presented an analysis of why large projects fail to meet their objectives. As someone who has witnessed the ups and downs of loads of projects, I&amp;rsquo;m very curious to learn what we can do better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to use this blog to think, learn, and work in public..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I chose this name because I want to be able to write stuff without having to definitely commit forever to holding whatever ideas I have shared.  Therefore these posts are just things I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; I think.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
