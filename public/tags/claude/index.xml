      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anthropic recently released &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.anthropic.com/news/cowork&#34;&gt;Cowork mode&lt;/a&gt; for Claude. It&amp;rsquo;s similar to Claude Code in that it&amp;rsquo;s highly agentic, has access to skills, and can make changes to files on your computer. But it has a nicer interface than Claude Code and is aimed at non-programmers, giving them access to the kind of general agent that all of us technical folk have been enjoying for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You select a folder from your hard drive, give Claude a task, and it spins up a little virtual computer of its own that can read and edit those files. It&amp;rsquo;s allowed to browse the web, produce outputs, write its own code, and stuff like this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Exploring the Claude Agent SDK</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At a recent Claude Code meetup, one of the Anthropic staff mentioned that anything Claude Code can do, you can do using the Agent SDK. That caught my attention. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Claude Code heavily, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really understood what was happening under the hood. So I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to dig in and document what I learn as I go.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of having a specialised version of Claude that understands my writing process, the tools I use, and the way I like to work. So as a toy experiment, I&amp;rsquo;m working on a writing agent built on the Claude Agent SDK.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Three Things I Did Over Christmas</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the nice things about not having work over the Christmas break is that it gives me a chance to play a little.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This year I had three main projects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;finishing-my-llm-evals-course-notes&#34;&gt;Finishing My LLM Evals Course Notes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I finally wrote up the last of my notes on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://thingsithinkithink.blog/01-05-llm-evals-course-recap/&#34;&gt;LLM Evals course&lt;/a&gt;, including an overall summary and an index page pulling together all eight lessons. It felt good to close the loop on something I&amp;rsquo;d been chipping away at for months.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
