I really love reading, I feel good about myself when I read more, but I struggle to resist the allure of the internet and the ease of access that my phone gives me to a never-ending slot machine of interesting things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kindle Oasis has just enough connectivity built in to be useful. Long press a word and you can look it up in the dictionary or check Wikipedia. Occasionally I&amp;rsquo;d want to understand something from a book a bit better and I&amp;rsquo;d open the Kindle&amp;rsquo;s web browser to look it up. The browser used to be labelled &amp;ldquo;experimental&amp;rdquo; and while they&amp;rsquo;ve dropped that label, it&amp;rsquo;s still very bare-bones. Most modern websites render fine, albeit they don&amp;rsquo;t perform very well, but it&amp;rsquo;s not really been something that bothered me until recently.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Three Things I Did Over Christmas</title><link>https://thingsithinkithink.blog/posts/2026/01-07-christmas-break-projects/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thingsithinkithink.blog/posts/2026/01-07-christmas-break-projects/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;One of the nice things about not having work over the Christmas break is that it gives me a chance to play a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I had three main projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="finishing-my-llm-evals-course-notes"&gt;Finishing My LLM Evals Course Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally wrote up the last of my notes on the &lt;a href="https://thingsithinkithink.blog/01-05-llm-evals-course-recap/"&gt;LLM Evals course&lt;/a&gt;, including an overall summary and an index page pulling together all eight lessons. It felt good to close the loop on something I&amp;rsquo;d been chipping away at for months.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
