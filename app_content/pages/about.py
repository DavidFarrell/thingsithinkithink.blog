I worked in web and games before moving to academia, where I got my PhD, learned how to learn, and became a lecturer. I studied computer science, cognitive science, emotion psychology, personalisation of pedagogic systems and so much more.  It was a breadth-first research group and I'm very thankful for my time there. 

I brought in funding and ran a small research lab making things for external partners. I was never a 'pure' researcher and always ended up _building_ things with teams.  My small Paidia group had something of a research focus but really, we were more like a wee consultancy, focusing on 0-1 product development (partnering with non-technical researchers who needed help bringing their ideas to life). This taught me how to translate abstract ideas into concrete designs but it also taught me delivery management, product management, and how to work with stakeholders to craft proposals and create things people love.

I left academia a few years ago to return to the 'real world'. Since then, I've been consulting, mostly in the public sector. These days I'm lucky enough to focus almost exclusively on helping folk take advantage of AI.
