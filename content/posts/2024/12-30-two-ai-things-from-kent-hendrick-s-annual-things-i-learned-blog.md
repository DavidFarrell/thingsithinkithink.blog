Two AI things I learned reading Kent Hendricks' annual ["Things I learned"](https://kenthendricks.com/52-things-i-learned-in-2024/) blog post:


1. The introduction of ChatGPT led to a 2% decrease in freelance job postings on Upwork.

2. While humans emit 27g of CO₂ when writing 300 words, ChatGPT accomplishes this in 4.4 seconds, producing only 2.2g of CO₂. 



I’m relieved that using an LLM for grunt work doesn’t automatically force us to sacrifice caring about the climate. However, the notion of valuing people based on their carbon output feels dystopian ( like something out of Black Mirror).
