I wantt to use this blog to think, learn, and work in public.. 

I chose this name because, during my PhD, I struggled significantly with writer's block, and I had the most patient PhD supervisor, David Moffat. David was (is) excellent at helping me work through things.  He is very socratic in his approach and he helped me understand the reasons behind my writer's block, much of which stemmed from a feeling of needing to be perfect.

I felt that if I was going to share something in public, I would be embarrassed if someone pointed out that I didn't understand something.  I would over prepare for presentations and only feel 'safe' giving one if I felt I had anticipated any possible angle and was ready with my defense. This fear often led me to refuse to write. However, in the informal setting of a PhD supervision meeting, we would engage in debates that lasted for hours. David pushed me to lower the stakes with my writing to the point where I committed to writing only for him about **things I think I think.**

This was a low bar; I wasn't even claiming to believe these ideas, just that I _might_ believe them, or that mibbe I was just holding the idea for a while to consider _what it might mean_ to believe such a thing. This approach made me feel safe and allowed me to share nascent ideas that weren't fully formed. The most value comes when you don't wait until you are completely confident. You gain the most value when you throw something out into the universe and let it push back.

I want this blog to be a place where I can share my thoughts. Whether it is something I enjoyed from a podcast or an article, a tutorial I followed, a piece of work I completed, or an interesting comment someone made at some meetup, I want to capture it.

I want to write a blog because I benefit greatly from reading others' work, and I also gain clarity in my thinking through writing. David used to say that **writing is thinking,** and it took me some time to understand what he meant. He meant that while you can hold an idea (full of contradictions) loosely in your mind, the moment you put it down on paper, you are compelled to confront the ambiguities. Therefore, the act of writing is indeed the act of thinking.

I hope this blog can serve as a space primarily for myself. I may enjoy revisiting these entries, or at least take comfort in knowing that I created them. However, I also hope that someone else might find something useful here as well.
