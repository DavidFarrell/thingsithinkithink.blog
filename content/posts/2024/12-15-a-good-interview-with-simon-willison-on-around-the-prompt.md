Things I like:
* Simon's stance that AI is exciting and amazing when it's a cyborg like enhancement to us.  Wehn it makes idnividuals 10 or 20 times as procuctive and creative. .
* Simosn' stance that it sucks taht AI is nto going to be usiversally good for people - heis ample of illustrators is one i feel very much aving sworked iwth, taught and been friendds with many artist sover the years -
* simons take that htese thignsa re hard to use. it' seasy to get a really impressive 'thing' to happen but it's hard to get dependable consitetn value from them and they are hard to master
*  these thigns also go against what we know computers to do well - like  
    *   a computer system that can't do multiplication of large numbers is absurd to people
    *   needing to understandg somethig nof training and training cut off dates

    * there is way more to building great software than putting a prompt in and getting functional code out

* a story where he points out legitimite reasons to want uncensored LLMS - when doing analysis ina  journalism context you may want to feed material for reporting and the LLM will refuse to answer the queswtions.  He shares an example about asking Claude to extract campaign finance data from a report and Claude refused because it was worried about sharing personal ifnacancial data 
  * thi sis a valid thign to do btu the LLM refused - that's not really acceptable 
* a simialr story abotu polic bodycam footage  - some journalist had to remidn the model that some dogs bite people beacuse the mnodel is trainged in internet data and the internet loves dogs
*  foudnatoion model providders aRE TOO Scared to share unflitered models because they know jourallists will create scare stories - ita'ts a readl lconundurm




## things i think i think 

 i feel the same way about musicians and writers too - they tend not to be the best paid roels in companies and it feels very ufnari that righ tislicon vlley types are going to kind of each tehir lunch 
* I share his hoep that peopel affected are able to harneesss the tools - I hope the next time I work with an illustrator, they use AI to be more producte and creative - i'd rather than than a random just give me AI tat.

  The first wave of genai adoption was marked by amazing POCs that couldn't turn into prodeucts - i think there's a mirror to individual use too.  IT's super easy to very quickly uncover amazing abilities of llm s and get an immediate benfit - but to get that consistanly and with edge case prtection it's much harder

  models being hard to grok
      *  with rag systems - understanding that the data you put in the context 'competes' wiht data form trainign - that's not intuitive
    *  building an intuition of what they're good and badd at - it's not simple - an LLM can be BRILLIANT at doing a psecific task but be terrible at knowledge depe

    * I'm a his LLM commandline tool - i've been playing with shell sage from Answser.ai recently though and I think it fits my workflow a wee bit better -= the combo of shell sage and tmux is brill because the llm can see my history and thus it can see what went wrong or what i'm trying to do without me prompting it - I liek the *way* it helps too but really tis' the context tha tmaeks teh workflow better - that wsaid, he's alreayd taking llm in a multimodal direction and I very much imagine using the abiltiy to just pipe in images or videos adn output some kind of insithg to be somethign i'll do soon
* llms can be a HUGE accellerator - if you are using a lanague youe don't knwo and get an eeror you don't udnerstand they can help yo unot jusut fix it but to epxlain the concepts you need in metaphors you understand etc
