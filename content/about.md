I'm David GÃ©rouville-Farrell. This is my blog.

I worked in web and games before moving to academia, where I got my PhD and published around 40 papers. I designed curricula and taught hundreds of students on all kinds of modules. I picked up a wide range of skills - from technical to research to design. Most valuable though was learning how to learn.

I ran a small research lab making things for external partners. I was never a 'pure' researcher and always ended up _building_ things.  My small Paidia team did some research but really, we were like a wee consultancy, focusing on 0-1 product development. This taught me delivery management, product management, and how to work with stakeholders to write proposals and create things people love.

I left academia a few years ago to return to the 'real world'. Since then, I've been consulting, mostly in the public sector. These days I'm lucky enough to focus almost exclusively on helping folk take advantage of AI.
